# Step 5 Seeing What Else You Can Do

One the key concepts in [Netconf](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6241) is ["capabilities"](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6241#section-1.3). These capabilities are implemented by the network elements that the controller manages, and the controller acts as an agent for the network elements, passing through what it discovers on the network elements. What this means overall, then, is that the main factor determining what you can do next is what the network elements support.

To see what capabilities the network elements support, use any script with a file name containing the word \*capability\*.

* 02_capability.py - Prints the capabilities supported by each device.

```
./02_capability.py 
por (http://cisco.com/ns/yang/Cisco-IOS-XR-shellutil-cfg?revision=2013-07-22)Cisco-IOS-XR-shellutil-cfg
por (http://cisco.com/ns/yang/Cisco-IOS-XR-ifmgr-oper?revision=2013-07-22)Cisco-IOS-XR-ifmgr-oper
por (http://cisco.com/ns/yang/Cisco-IOS-XR-infra-infra-cfg?revision=2013-07-22)Cisco-IOS-XR-infra-infra-cfg
...
```

* 02_capability_discovery.py - Checks which devices have specific, advanced, capabilities such as ACLs and static routes.

```
./02_capability_discovery.py 
capability_discovery(Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv4-acl-cfg, http://cisco.com/ns/yang/):
	 por 2015-01-07
	 lax 2015-01-07
	...

capability_discovery(Cisco-IOS-XR-ip-static-cfg, http://cisco.com/ns/yang/):
	 por 2015-01-07
	 lax 2015-01-07
	 ...

capability_discovery(not_available_yet, coming_soon):
	 None

...
```
For each section of scripts for a given feature, there is also a script that will test which devices have the required capability to work with the feature, e.g.:
		
* 04_static_route_capability.py - Iterate through connected devices looking for the capability to add static routes.

```
./04_static_route_capability.py
Python Library Documentation: function capability_discovery in module basics.inventory

capability_discovery(capability_name=None, capability_ns=None, capability_revision=None, device_name=None)
    Discover the revision of the specified capability for a set of devices.
    
    The entire inventory will be examined unless a single device is specified.
    Function output is a list of tuples. 
    Each tuple consists of (device_name, (capability_name, capability_ns, capability_revision).

capability_discovery(device_name=sjc, capability_name=Cisco-IOS-XR-ip-static-cfg, capability_ns=http://cisco.com/ns/yang/)
	 ('sjc', ('Cisco-IOS-XR-ip-static-cfg', 'http://cisco.com/ns/yang/', '2015-01-07'))
```

* 05_acl_capability.py - Iterate through the connected devices looking for the capability to configure ACLs.

```
./05_acl_capability.py
Python Library Documentation: function capability_discovery in module basics.inventory

capability_discovery(capability_name=None, capability_ns=None, capability_revision=None, device_name=None)
    Discover the revision of the specified capability for a set of devices.
    
    The entire inventory will be examined unless a single device is specified.
    Function output is a list of tuples. 
    Each tuple consists of (device_name, (capability_name, capability_ns, capability_revision).

capability_discovery(device_name=sjc, capability_name=Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv4-acl-cfg, capability_ns=http://cisco.com/ns/yang/)
('sjc', ('Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv4-acl-cfg', 'http://cisco.com/ns/yang/', '2015-01-07'))
```

As this is a growing body of code, to see which scripts there are, use the `ls` command as shown below (note that this is a just an elided example of what you will see, as the content will grow over time): 

```
ls -1 *_capability*.py
02_capability.py
02_capability_compare.py
02_capability_discovery.py
02_capability_matrix.py
04_static_route_capability.py
05_acl_capability.py
```

Scripts that require a particular capability, such as `05_acl_capability.py`, will fail elegantly with an appropriate message when the network topology does not contain a network device that is capable.

Capabilities are explored in the following related topics.

* [Interfaces](4.md)
* [Static Routes](5.md)
* [ACLs](6.md)
* [Topology](7.md)
