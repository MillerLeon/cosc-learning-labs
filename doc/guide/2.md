# Step 2 Displaying the Connected Devices

Use the	01_inventory_connected.py scripts to display the connected devices:

```bash
$ ./01_inventory_connected.py 
Python Library Documentation: function inventory_connected in module basics.inventory
inventory_connected()
    Names of network devices connected to the Controller.
    Output a list of names.
    Connected devices are a subset of the inventory.
['sea', 'por', 'san', 'lax', 'sjc', 'sfc', 'kcy', 'min']
```

The output above indicates that the controller has mounted the XRv devices, and that all devices connected properly. If you do not see that they connected properly, try again. It can take a several minutes for all of the network elements to mount and connect.
After that, there are additional sets of scripts to examine certain components and set properties on those components, as appropriate.
