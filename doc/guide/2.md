# Step 2 Displaying the Connected Devices and Inventory

* 01_inventory_connected - Show the connected devices:

```bash
$ ./01_inventory_connected.py 
Python Library Documentation: function inventory_connected in module basics.inventory
inventory_connected()
    Names of network devices connected to the Controller.
    Output a list of names.
    Connected devices are a subset of the inventory.
['sea', 'por', 'san', 'lax', 'sjc', 'sfc', 'kcy', 'min']
```

The output above indicates that the controller has mounted the XRv devices, and that all devices connected properly. If you do not see that they connected properly, try again. It can take a several minutes for all of the network elements to mount and connect.

After that, there are additional sets of scripts to examine certain components and set properties on those components, as appropriate.

* 01_inventory_not_connected - Show which devices are mounted, but not connected to the controller.

```bash
$ ./01_inventory_not_connected.py

cosc authentication url: https://198.18.1.25/controller-auth
...
cosc authentication status code: 201
Python Library Documentation: function inventory_not_connected in module basics.inventory

inventory_not_connected()
    Names of network devices mounted on the Controller but not connected to the Controller.

['openflow:1', 'openflow:6', 'openflow:7', 'openflow:4', 'openflow:5', 'openflow:2', 'openflow:3']
```

See https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/cosc-learning-labs/issues/25

* 01_inventory_summary_html - Print a HTML table of the inventory with the connected status and number of Netconf capabilities.

```bash
$ ./01_inventory_summary_html.py

cosc authentication url: https://198.18.1.25/controller-auth
...
cosc authentication status code: 201
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Is Connected</th>
        <th>Number of Capabilities</th>
    </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>openflow:1</th>
        <td style="text-align:center">False</td>
        <td style="text-align:right">5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>por</th>
        <td style="text-align:center">True</td>
        <td style="text-align:right">42</td>
    </tr>
   ...

</table>
```

* 01_inventory_summary - Print a list of the inventory, with the connected status and number of Netconf capabilities.

```bash
$ ./01_inventory_summary.py

cosc authentication url: https://198.18.1.25/controller-auth
cosc authentication parameters:
   username = admin
   scope = sdn
   password = cisco123
   grant_type = password
cosc authentication status code: 201
Python Library Documentation: function inventory_summary in module basics.inventory

inventory_summary()
    'Return a list containing one instance of InventorySummary per inventory item.

InventorySummary fields:
	name
	connected
	capabilities

InventorySummary(name='openflow:1', connected=False, capabilities=5)
InventorySummary(name='por', connected=True, capabilities=42)
...

```

* 01_inventory_control - Show the device control, i.e. connection details and credentials, data for each device in the inventory.

```bash
$ ./01_inventory_control.py

cosc authentication url: https://198.18.1.25/controller-auth
...
cosc authentication status code: 201
Python Library Documentation: function inventory_control in module basics.inventory

inventory_control()
    List the DeviceControl for every mounted device.
    
    Return type is 'list of DeviceControl'.
    If no devices are mounted the list returned is empty.

DeviceControl fields:
	device_name
	address
	port
	username
	password

inventory_control():
	 sjc 198.18.1.57 830 cisco cisco
	 por 198.18.1.53 830 cisco cisco
...
```
