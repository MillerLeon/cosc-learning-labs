* 01_inventory_mount - Cause the server to use Netconf to mount the XRv instances in the configuration file.

```bash
$ ./01_inventory_mount.py

cosc authentication status code: 201
Python Library Documentation: function device_mount in module basics.inventory

device_mount(device_name, device_address, device_port, device_username, device_password)
    Add the specified network device to the inventory of the Controller.
device_mount(lax, cisco, cisco, 830, 198.18.1.51)
...
```

* 01_inventory_mounted - Show which devices have been mounted.

```bash
$ ./01_inventory_mounted.py

Python Library Documentation: function inventory_mounted in module basics.inventory

inventory_mounted()
    Names of network devices mounted on the Controller.
    
    Output a list of names.
    Mounted devices are a subset of the inventory.
    Mounted devices can be connected or not.

['sjc', 'por', 'sfc', 'min', 'sea', 'san', 'lax', 'kcy']
```

* 01_device_dismount - Show how to dismount a given device.

```bash
cosc authentication url: https://198.18.1.25/controller-auth
...
cosc authentication status code: 201
Python Library Documentation: function device_dismount in module basics.inventory

device_dismount(device_name)
    Remove one network device from the inventory of the Controller.
    
    It is not necessary for the device to be connected. 
    The outcome is undefined if the device is not already mounted.

device_dismount(sjc)
```

* 01_inventory_unmounted - Show which devices in the configuration are not mounted. Note that this example shows the state after the `01_device_dismount` script was used to unmount a device. 

```bash

$ ./01_inventory_unmounted.py

cosc authentication url: https://198.18.1.25/controller-auth
...
cosc authentication status code: 201
Python Library Documentation: function inventory_unmounted in module basics.inventory

inventory_unmounted()
    Names of network devices not mounted on the Controller.
    
    Returns a list.

['sjc']

```

* 01_device_mount - Mount a device in the configuration.  Note that this example shows the state after the `01_device_dismount` script was used to unmount a device. 

```bash
$ ./01_device_mount.py

cosc authentication url: https://198.18.1.25/controller-auth

device_mount(device_name, device_address, device_port, device_username, device_password)
    Add the specified network device to the inventory of the Controller.

device_mount(sjc, cisco, cisco, 830, 198.18.1.57)
```

* 01_device_mounted - Show if a given device is mounted.

```bash
$ ./01_device_mounted.py

cosc authentication url: https://198.18.1.25/controller-auth

mounted(device_name)
    Determine whether a single device is mounted on the Controller.
    
    Return True if mounted.
